                    <p>Wolves have been my favorite animal ever since I can remember. They are basically giant dogs, so anyone who loves dogs should love wolves. Also, the internet has told me that wolves have a pack mentality, never leaving a member behind. It was the internet, so it must be true. Plus, the internet also said wolf pairs are more loyal than most human couples, and if that isn't love, then I don't know what is. Plus (again), wolves are super duper cute and they like to howl which is also super cute. They can be really vicious, but I pretend like we would actually be friends if I ever came across one in the wild of my backyard.</p>

                    <p>I'm not sure when goats became my second favorite animal, but at some point in the last ten years, they did. They have these silly faces and they love to scream randomly (and when provoked), so I can really relate to them. Like in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfGc8RkRJO0">video</a> where they yell back at their human. They remind me of those green aliens from Toy Story when they talk about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-Esh4W3dfI">the claw</a>. Anyway, goats are awesome and people who hate goats probably have never been to Grant's Farm to feed the pygmy goats. If you don't like goats, we should plan a trip to Grant's Farm.</p>

                    <h3>My dog, Nikita</h3>
                    <figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Nikita is my baby girl who I got when I was a freshman in college. She was born September 22, 2010, and we met 11 weeks later. She is a husky, so basically a domesticated wolf. I love wolves (see <a href="#wolves">above</a>). Huskies are also super awesome because they like to talk a lot. There are tons of videos on YouTube you can check out of them talking. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXo3NFqkaRM">Mishka</a> I think is the most famous talking husky, but Nikita is all white and she's my fur-daughter so she is the most famous in my book.</p>

                    <h3>My other dog, Roscoe</h3>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Roscoe is my other dog. My boyfriend and I adopted him from some friends, who rescued him, so we don't know his birthday. He is pretty cool, but he can be really annoying. He likes to bark at nothing, escape from enclosed areas, and wake people up with his disgusting farts. But I still love him because he is my baby dog. Plus, him and Nikita are really adorable together, which makes life even better because I cry at their cuteness.</p>

                    <p>I have had several cats growing up. The most recent kitty I had had to be put down a couple years ago. We got him when I was super young. My sister Kayleigh and I begged and begged and begged for what seemed like an eternity until our dad finally gave in. In reality, it was probably more like a week, but I digress. Anyway, the deal was we can only get a cat if we named him after my dad's favorite football player: Dan Marino. And that is the story of how we named my cat Marino Dan Moran. It rhymes, so me and my sis think it's hilarious. </p>
